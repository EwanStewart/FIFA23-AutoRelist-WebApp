# FIFA23-AutoRelist-WebApp
 A Selenium based Python script which automates the relisting of FIFA 23 items.
 
 This script requires FIFA 23 login data to be stored within a Chrome profile and the path to the profile added to the browser setup within the code.
 
 This script is best utilised on a scheduler, such as Cron on a low-energy consumption micro-computer.
